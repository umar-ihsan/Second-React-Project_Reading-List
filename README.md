# Reading List

## Description
I created this to practice context api, reducers and hooks in react. this is my second ever project in react.
It's very basic, just a reading list with a form where you can add books and you can click on them to delete them.
The books are stored in the browser's local storage and are fetched from there whenever you refresh the page.


## Technologies Used
- React (Context API, Hooks, Reducers, Browser's Local Storage)
